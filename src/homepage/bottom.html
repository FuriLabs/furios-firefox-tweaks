	<h2>How to install add-ons</h2>
	<p class="text">
	Use the official
	<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/">add-on website</a>
	from Mozilla. Take care, some add-ons require a lot of access to your
	data and may not be respectful of your privacy. Here is a free software
	add-on that we trust:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li> <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/ublock-origin/">uBlock Origin</a>:
			a wide-spectrum content blocker, that prevents most
			websites from wasting <i>your</i> resources (time,
			traffic, battery, CPU and RAM).
	</ul>

	<h2>How to change settings</h2>
	<p class="text">
	Read on to set a different homepage, search engine or change other
	options. Tap the collapsed menu icon on the top right, then select
	<i>Preferences</i>. Tap the same icon again and decrease the
	<i>Zoom</i> level to <i>50%</i>, so the page becomes readable. Next,
	tap the category of the setting you want to change on the left &mdash;
	house for <i>Homepage</i>, magnifying glass for <i>Search</i>. Finally,
	change the desired setting on the right.
